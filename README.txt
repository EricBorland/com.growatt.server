Connect your Growatt residential or Off-grid storage systems to Homey and take the most out of it.

How this differ from the "Solar Panels" application?
This is only focused on Growatt and mainly with storage-based systems, which are not supported by the Solar Panels application.

Moreover, it has custom capabilities like: solar production, battery production and SOC, grid consumption and more.

Note: Only tested with SPF 5000TL HVM-WPV/WPV-P but it should work with others.
If you find any issue with your inverter other than that, please let me know.
